# 🚀🐟 starship.fish

[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) plugin for [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

Advantages over plain `starship init fish | source`:

- [Faster shell startup](https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/2637) by *AOT* initialization
- Setup Starship's shell completions
- Restore default prompts when Starship is unavailable, or the plugin is disabled/uninstalled

## Installation

- [plug.fish](https://github.com/kidonng/plug.fish)

  ```sh
  plug install kidonng/starship.fish
  ```

- [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

  ```sh
  fisher install kidonng/starship.fish
  ```
